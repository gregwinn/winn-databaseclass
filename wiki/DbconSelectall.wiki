= Select All =
*This method will get all records from a table.*

=== How to use ===
This method needs two items:
 # The table name that you will be selecting items from
 # The columns you want returned

This method will only do a 'mysql_query', to display the data you will need to use the function 'mysql_fetch_array'.

Below is how to use:

{{{
$db = new dbcon;

$select = $db->selectall('accounts','all');

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($select)) {
   print $row['firstname'];
}
}}}

The above code will output the column value of 'firstname'.
